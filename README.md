# Addition of Two Numbers in Django

This project is a simple Django web application that takes two numbers as input and displays their sum. It's my first project using Django, demonstrating the basic concepts I've learned in web development with this framework.



## Usage

Enter two numbers into the input fields and click the 'Add' button. The application will display the sum of the two numbers.
